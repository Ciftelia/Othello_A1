RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy? 

-- The games starts in the balanced state, and neither uses strategy, randomness doesn't favour one side over the other.
   After many repeated games, wins tends to even out between two players. So, far this assignment, we can safely assume 
   that both players have the same likelihood of winning when they play randomly.

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:
-- The video highlights how important is to set up a proper null hypothesis and use the right statistical test
   when checking whether a difference is meaningful. A p-value doesnâ€™t prove one strategy is better, it just tell
   us how surprising our data would be if there were no difference.
   
   For this assignment, that supports using a two-proportion z-test on the Random-vs-Random results instead of eyeballing percentages.
   This method also keeps the simulation separate from the statistics: first, run independent game trials. Then, examine whether any 
   win-rate gap is too large to be due to chance. Confidence intervals help show how sure we are about the results as well.
   





4) H0 is p1=p2 ; p1 = Probability (Player1-random) wins, p2 = Probability (Player2-random) wins

5) Ha is p1!=p2

6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   My experimental results support H0, so they do not support Ha
  

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
